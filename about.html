                <p>I have a couple of years of experience at CSC, India as an Associate Professional Product Developer. Working in the insurance domain required efficient communication with the clients for collecting the business requirements, ensuring the quality of the product being developed and also ensuring timely delivery of the same. Our motto as an organization was always client satisfaction and having a client-centric behaviour. I was timely awarded client appreciation for my quality of development and behaviour.</p>
                <p>Also, I have 6 years of experience working as a Student Coordinator, Student Supervisor, and Grader combined at Arihant Academy, India which is responsible for providing quality education to various students. As a Coordinator, I was responsible for conducting all type of exams for Arihant Academy. Handling students at the exam centre/hall came along being a Student Coordinator. Commencing and concluding every exam at a given time was the major responsibility accounting to a number of students of at the exam centre. Also, understanding students and their problems during the exam time would prove to be of great help to the students. This required constant communication with the management team at the office for any kind of instructions for the students. As a grader, I used to grade different courses for 8th, 9th, and 10th grade students and also, helped management staff to overcome their issue of delay in grading.</p>
                <p><b>Accomplishment proud of:</b> Developing and deploying a project as a fresher where I was the only developer in the team, with continuous client interaction was my proudest accomplishment.
